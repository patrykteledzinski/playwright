// To complete this API automation challenge, I would follow the following steps:

//     Fork the repository and clone it to my local machine
//     Start the service using the command docker-compose up
//     Verify that the service is running by accessing the swagger documentation at http://localhost:7070/swagger-ui.html
//     Study the API endpoints and their inputs/outputs, along with the business rules mentioned in the challenge description.
//     Based on my understanding, I would write test cases to cover all the possible scenarios, including:
//         Withdrawals count exceeding maxWithdrawals field value
//         Sum of all withdrawals exceeding maxWithdrawalAmount field value
//         Withdrawals with incorrect or missing data in the request
//         Withdrawals with executeAt set to a date outside the current month
//         Happy path scenario of executing immediate withdrawal
//     Implement the test cases using a testing framework of my choice, for example, Playwright in JavaScript.
//     Verify that all the test cases pass.
//     Generate a test execution report and save it in a format that is easily readable, for example, HTML.
//     Create a README.md file in the root of the project that contains instructions on how to build the project and run the tests.
//     Package the entire project and send it as a single archive to the specified email address.
